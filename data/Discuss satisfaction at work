Is your job what you expected when you accepted it?
Are you happy with your recent work? Why or why not?
What’s something you feel is undervalued that you contribute to the team?
What part of your job do you wish you didn’t have to do?
What do you feel is your greatest accomplishment here?
Are you afraid of anything at work?
Are there any benefits we don’t offer that you’d like to see us offer?
